This project is for those who want to understand a bit better Approximate Message Passing algorithm for Compressed Sensing and its State Evolution.

When you download the files, you can just call the script "plot_SE". In the same script you can change some of the simulation parameters or the problem parametrs. 

If you have any comments write to me on osman.musa@tu-berlin.de. 

Have fun!
